> The basic UI of the Unity app, with an emphasis on clarity and professionalism.


## Plan for the future

> Create custom code to let users upload their own custom powerpoints or slideshows

> Allow users to see eachother

> Implement voice chat through Unity (proximity voice chat)

> Allow different scenes (Stage, auditorium, classroom)

> Create a fake audience (for those battling stage fright)

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
